#Helicon Python Sample App
This repository contains the files required to run the Helicon Python Quickstart.

Helicon is a simple, scalable, robust, code-free and generic platform to enable and productise the next generation of "online modified", real-time event stream ML/AI models.

## Set up the project

We suggest to use venv and install everything with it: Run `python3 -m venv venv` and `source venv/bin/activate` to create and activate the virtual environment venv.
Run `pip install --upgrade pip` to update pip to the latest version and tun `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the project.
To start to publish and/or subscribe to a topic stream you need to populate all the placeholder fields, defined like <placeholder>.
Then you can just run the `__main__` method inside each client example.

## Sample App
### Publish
This code is available at `helicon_publish/publish.py`. This example will publish as payload a json object like
```json
{
"temperature": 26,
"timestamp": 1632143723
}
```
The method `time.time()` is part of the __Python 3__ code base, so you don't need to install anything else to use it.
Additionally, you have to set an environment variable: GRPC_DEFAULT_SSL_ROOTS_FILE_PATH, providing the path of a certificates file.
```python
authorization_server = "<authorization-server>"
grpc_host = "<grpc-host>"
grpc_port = 0  # "<grpc-port-as-int>"
client_id = "<client-id>"
client_secret = "<client-secret>"
tenant = "<tenant-name>"
stream_name = "<stream-name>"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    os.environ["GRPC_DEFAULT_SSL_ROOTS_FILE_PATH"] = "path/to/roots.pem"
    
    helicon_client = HeliconPublishClient(authorization_server=authorization_server, server_host=grpc_host,
                                          server_port=grpc_port, client_id=client_id, client_secret=client_secret,
                                          tenant_name=tenant)

    payload = f'{{"temperature": 26, "timestamp": {time.time()}}}'
    helicon_client.write(stream_name, payload)
```
### Subscribe
Same for subscription (GRPC_DEFAULT_SSL_ROOTS_FILE_PATH setup included), the code is available at `helicon_subscribe/subscribe.py`, and it is going to print the message, and its fields, defined above.
```python
authorization_server = "<authorization-server>"
grpc_host = "<grpc-host>"
grpc_port = 0  # "<grpc-port-as-int>"
client_id = "<client-id>"
client_secret = "<client-secret>"
tenant = "<tenant-name>"
stream_name = "<stream-name>"


def process(event: Dict[str, Any]):
    print(event)
    print(event["temperature"])
    print(event["timestamp"])


if __name__ == '__main__':
    os.environ["GRPC_DEFAULT_SSL_ROOTS_FILE_PATH"] = "path/to/roots.pem"

    helicon_client = HeliconSubscribeClient(authorization_server=authorization_server, server_host=grpc_host,
                                            server_port=grpc_port, client_id=client_id, client_secret=client_secret,
                                            tenant_name=tenant)

    helicon_client.subscribe_json(stream_name, process)
```
To be able to read the data you are writing with the publishing client you need to subscribe to the same stream.
The message received will be parsed as a generic json object before being processed from the response processor.
To handle generic messages you can use `subscribe_string(stream_name, process)`, which will parse the message response as UTF-8 string.

## How to Run the app

Running the `__main__` method inside `subscribe.py` manually or with `python3 subscribe.py` command from a terminal, you will start to receive messages as soon as they are written on the stream.

To publish 1 message you can run the `__main__` method inside `publish.py` manually or with `python3 publish.py` command from a terminal, or, for multiple messages, you can wrap it in a loop.

You should see printed the response on the terminal.
