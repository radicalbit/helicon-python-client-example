# Helicon Python Quickstart #

This repository contains a python publish and subscribe client example.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Run `pip install -e .` to install the project. 
  To start to publish and/or subscribe to a topic stream you need to populate all the placeholder fields, defined like <placeholder>.
  Then you can just run the __main__ method inside each client example.
